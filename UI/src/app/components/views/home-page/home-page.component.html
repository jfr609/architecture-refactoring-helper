    The Architecture Refactoring Helper is a web application which aims to support architects in migrating monolithic
    systems towards a microservices architecture.
    The current state of this application is still in development and provides limited functionality as of now. The
    below framework depicts the common activities during a migration, grouped into three phases.

  <p class='max-width-800'>
    In phase 1, the scenarios can be defined based on the ATAM method and quality attributes can
    be assigned to them.
    In phase 2, a configurator can be used to obtain recommendations for migration approaches and service
    identifications
    based on the input filters. A scenario-based search is also available for this purpose. All existing proposals can
    be explored as well in this phase.
    In phase 3, possible patterns and best practices for the target architecture are suggested based on the inputs of
    the configuration from phase 2 or a scenario-based configuration. In addition, all existing patterns and best practices
    in the database can be explored.
